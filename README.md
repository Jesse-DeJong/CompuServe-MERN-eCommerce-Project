# CompuServe Computer Emporium

## Description

A MERN stack application utilising react for a responsive single-page eCommerce site focused around assisting the hardware-illiterate in choosing their next PC upgrade offering component advice and building services. 

## User Story

```md
AS A busy software engineer
WHEN friends and colleagues ask for computer recommendations
I WANT to be able to refer them to an automated process that will understand their use case and provide a recommendation I would support
SO THAT my contacts end up with a fit for purpose computer worth its cost 
```

## Usage

The site is live at `https://compuserve.herokuapp.com/`

## Roadmap

- Refined use case test and recommendation system
- Populate seed data with genuine products and articles
- Feature: PC configurer with prefilled parts for recommended templates
- Overhaul products/store section to expand usablility and feature set
- Overhaul UI
- Refactor code to clean it up and make common elements more consistent and in many instances accessed via react-components external to their file
- ...and much more
